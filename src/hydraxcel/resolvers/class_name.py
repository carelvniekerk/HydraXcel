    This resolver takes a config object and returns the class name of the object
    that would be returned by OmegaConf.to_object().

    Args:
        config_obj: The config object (e.g., cfg.trainer, cfg.model)

    Returns:
        The class name of the object that would be returned by OmegaConf.to_object()

    Example:
        # In your config YAML or when using the resolver:
        # trainer_name: ${get_class_name:${trainer}}
        # This would return something like "DPOTrainer"
